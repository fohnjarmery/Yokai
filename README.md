This mod adds a new playable clan to the game - the Yokai Clan!
Parading through heaven comes a march of free-spirited demons, enemies of order and standing in opposition to The Titans.

# Overview

The Yokai clan is focused on building large floors, unit-heavy strategies, lots of activated Abilities and disrupting the enemy through moving them around.
The clan features two new Status effects to assist them with this:

 -**Haunt**-
 
  Haunt is a Buff that can be applied to enemies and allies. It has no effect on enemy units however allied units will gain additional attack for every other Haunt 
  stack on allies. You're encouraged to get as many allied units on a floor as possible and spread out your Haunt applications for maximum damage. Additionally
  Haunt applied to enemies can augment the effects of certain spells and abilities.
  
 -**Panic**-
 
  Panic is a Debuff to be applied to enemies. It is a damaging debuff much like Frostbite or Decay however instead of applying at the end of turn, Panic triggers     
  whenever the afflicted unit moves, dealing one damage per stack. Trying to keep enemies on your Panic-applying floors and punishing them for moving away can be an 
  effective crowd-clearing strategy, or you can try to accumulate stacks on Flying Bosses to rack up damage over time.

As mentioned above, the Yokai units are very dependant on Abilities. More or less every Draftable unit has an Ability and whilst they may be less impactful than the 
Abilities of other clans, they made up for it by combining Abilities in various ways and promoting lots of units with Abilities working together through a new
trigger:

 -**Evoke**-
 
  A new Trigger from the Conductor modding tools - Evoke will trigger whenever an Allied Unit on the floor activates their Ability.

 # Known Issues
 There's currently no icon for the clan in the Logbook but you can still view them in there.
 
 The map node for their banner units always appears visited, even when it isn't. This is a known issue with Trainworks. Just be sure to check the banner.
 
 # To Do
 **Art** - Right now, the clan is using entirely placeholder art for cards/characters. I've tried to ensure the art is somewhat close to Monster Train 2's art but eventually I do plan to create my own art assets.
 
 **Tooltips** - A handful of the cards currently have tooltips missing. It's not a major issue, but I'd like it if the tooltips in the clan were consistent.
 
 **Balancing** - I've tried to keep the clan roughly similar to other MT2 clans in powerlevel but there's still balance-work to be done. I've been able to win a few Cov10 runs with the clan but if anyone has any balancing feedback I'd be happy to hear it!
 
 **Custom Effects** - Whilst the new status effects and triggers are unique, it would be nice to have a few more unique effects on cards. Hopefully as time passes and I learn more about coding I can expand on these.
